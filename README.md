## The Game

On the stroke of midnight you suddenly wake up and find someone in the corner of your bedroom staring at you. 
What was THAT noise?

'Hey! What are you doing in...
-Brains! :D
-What?
-Brrrrrr! :)
-What the hell dude? Get out of my bedroom!
-Mmmh? :(
-Plus you stink! Why do you... ZOMG YOU ARE A ZOMBIE!
-Mhhgmgg ;)'

Yes. It was a Zombie and it wanted your brain. Just like in those movies. So you kicked and punched till it did not move anymore. That's how a Zombie dies.
Then another came through the window.
And another through the door.
And another.
And then it never ended.

## Setting & objective
You must survive an urban Zombie apocalypse.
You have to find ways to survive : food, shelter, weapons and companions.
Your city has a persistent urban legend about some sort of monster lurking in the Sewers.
Your home town is also known for being the headquarters of the world famous C.H.A.R. Corporation. Recently you've heard strange rumors about them...
You can also play the game as an undead or reincarnate into different characters. These play modes are mostly for fun.
Most of the manual is written with playing a survivor in mind.
